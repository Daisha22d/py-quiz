# Quiz App with Vite + React

This repository contains a step-by-step guide on how to create a quiz application using Vite and React, with JSX for building the user interface.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the quiz application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```terminal
   git clone https://github.com/Daisha22d/skincare-quiz.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```terminal
   cd my-quiz
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```terminal
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

1. Start the development server:

   ```terminal
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the quiz application in action.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, you can run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized and minified files in the `dist` directory.

## Features

- **Vite + React:** Utilizes the Vite build tool along with the React library for a fast and efficient development experience.
- **JSX:** Writes the user interface components using JSX syntax, which allows for a more expressive and intuitive way to create UI elements.
- **Interactive Quiz:** The application provides an interactive quiz where users can answer multiple-choice questions and get their results.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the quiz application.
  - `main.js`: Entry point for the Vite app.
  - `Quiz.js`: React component representing the main quiz interface.
  - `quizData.js`: Contains the quiz questions and answer options.
- `public/`: Contains static assets like HTML files and images.
- `dist/`: Generated production build files.
