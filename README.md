Test your beginner-level knowledge of Python with this mini quiz app built using React. This app presents you with a set of 10 multiple-choice questions about Python programming. Choose the correct answer for each question and see your score at the end!

## Features

- **Reusability:** React components like the Question and AnswerChoice components are reused throughout the app, avoiding repetitive code and making development more efficient.

- **Managing State:** React's `useState` hook is utilized for managing dynamic aspects of the quiz, such as the current question and the user's score.

- **Interactive and Dynamic:** React's strength in building interactive user interfaces shines in this app, allowing users to select answers and see immediate feedback.

- **Efficiency:** React's virtual DOM ensures that changes are efficiently rendered, providing a smooth user experience as questions and answers are updated.

- **Simplicity:** React's component-based architecture simplifies the development of complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, reusable parts. Building a quiz becomes straightforward and organized.

- **In-Demand Skill:** Proficiency in React is a valuable and in-demand skill in the web development field. Developing projects like this mini quiz demonstrates your ability to apply React concepts to real-world applications.

- **Scalability:** With React's modular architecture, the app can be easily scaled to accommodate more questions, additional features, and enhanced functionality.
